# React Grocery List
During the Covid 19 Pandemic, my family had trouble organizing grocery lists and my mother was becoming overwhelmed by constant random text messages containing bits and pieces of recipes. I was in the middle of a quarter of school so I built a super quick JQuery and SQL grocery list which can be viewed [here](). However, after a couple weeks of use I began to wonder how I could improve both the UI and the backend. In my addition, problems arose such as not knowing which family members added certain items and ambiguity over which products to purchase. I solved these problem by building Grocer-ease. By providing Oauth sign in strategies as well as local authentication options, I can track who added what as well as collect timestamps. By web scraping google images, I can provide automated specificity to items on the list.
